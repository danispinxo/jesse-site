        <h4>Jesse Pajuäär</h4>
        <h5>Registered Psychotherapist, DTATI, HBA.</h5>
        I approach each session with the belief that you are the expert of your own life. There are no judgements or assumptions made during our time. My focus is on collaborating with you to create a space where your voice, your wants, and your unique perspective  can not only be heard, but supported and advocated for.
        <br />
        You are not the problem, the problem is the problem.
