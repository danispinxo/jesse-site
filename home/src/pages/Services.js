        <h3>Art Psychotherapy</h3>
        <p>
        Using creative practices as a way to help reframe and (re)examine how we look at ourselves, our relationships, and the world. Art psychotherapy isn't about the end goal of creating “Art,” but about the process.
        <br/>
        This process means tapping into parts of the brain that often get overlooked or underused, but actually provide a wealth of knowledge about how we each uniquely experience and perceive the world.
