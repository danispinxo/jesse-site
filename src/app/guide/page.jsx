        <p>
          If you search “therapist Toronto” the Internet will give you millions
          of search results. Literally. Finding the right therapist can feel
          hopeless and exhausting. And if you&apos;re searching for a therapist,
          you&apos;re probably already under a certain amount of stress as it
          is. Don&apos;t despair! Streamline your search by working through the
          FOUR following steps:

            Psychiatrist, psychologist, psychotherapist—are you confused about
            the differences? You&apos;re definitely not alone, but the key
            distinctions are worth knowing and could make all the difference in
            your search.

          <p className="subtitle">1. A psychiatrist is a medical doctor.</p>
          <ul className="single-column">
            <li>
              They can prescribe drugs (i.e., anti-depressant, anti-anxiety, or
              anti-psychotic medication)
            </li>
            <li>
              They can diagnose psychiatric illnesses (i.e., depression,
              bi-polar disorder, ADHD, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>Their services are covered by OHIP</li>
            <li>They sometimes offer counselling</li>
            <li>
              You typically need a medical referral to see a psychiatrist and
              the wait time can be significant (i.e., several months). It may be
              particularly difficult to get an appointment without indication of
              an underlying medical/psychiatric condition.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="subtitle">
            2. A psychologist or psychological associate has a Ph.D. or M.A. in
            psychology.

          <ul className="single-column">
            <li>They cannot prescribe medication</li>
            <li>
              They are trained in research methodologies and can administer
              psychological tests, assessments or diagnoses for some
              neurological or mental-health related issues (i.e., anxiety)
            </li>

            <li>You may need a referral to see some psychologists</li>

              Your insurance may cover psychotherapist services—check to see
              whether your coverage includes the designation Registered
              Psychotherapist or RP
            </li>
            <li>
              Their training includes counselling skills and clinical practice

            <li>You do not need a referral to see a psychotherapist</li>
            <li>
              Psychotherapists are regulated by the College of Registered
              Psychotherapists of Ontario (the CRPO), which holds them to
              educational, professional, and ethical standards
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="subtitle">4. There are other options too:</p>
          <ul className="single-column">
            <li>
              Counsellors, coaches, and social workers who work in spaces other
              than psychotherapy are also options. There are also pastoral or
              spiritual guides who offer counselling services. Some of these
              areas are regulated (i.e., social work) and others are not (i.e.,
              coaching). There are excellent practitioners in every field so
              it&apos;s really about doing your homework and deciding which kind
              counsellor best suits your personal needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Although psychotherapists cannot prescribe medication or diagnose
              mental health conditions, we often work with clients who are
              taking psychotropic medication and/or who have diagnoses (i.e.,
              for depression, anxiety, PTSD, eating disorders, etc.).
              Psychotherapists often play a role in an integrated approach to
              managing formally diagnosed conditions.

            So, if you&apos;re still reading this AND you think psychotherapy
            could be the right for you then proceed to Step TWO. Otherwise, you
            may want to consult with your family physician for a referral to a
            psychiatrist or psychologist, or even conduct your own research into
            some of the other above-mentioned areas.

            If you search the Psychology Today directory for therapists in
            Toronto you&apos;re still going to come up with 50+ pages of
            entries. And some of those ads will contain technical information
            you might find confusing and off-putting. By refining your search by
            asking yourself the following is a helpful way that you can wade
            through all that psycho-babble to find your match:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Identify your main problem or issue: why are you coming to
              therapy?
              <ul className="single-column">
                <li>Are you struggling with a career issue?</li>
                <li>Are you feeling anxious?</li>
                <li>Is your marriage on the rocks?</li>
                <li>Are you mourning a loss? Are you fighting an addiction?</li>
              </ul>
              Look for a practitioner who has experience and interest in working
              with your specific issue. Most therapists do list their areas of
              experience or interest on their web sites and many directories let
              you search by issue. <br />
              <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              Decide whether you have a preferred treatment approach. This is
              where people often start to feel bogged down: psychodynamic,
              relational, transpersonal, CBT, EFT, EMDR? What does it all mean?
              Does this even matter?
              <br /> <br />
              Your therapist&apos;s approach is important because it speaks to
              how they will help you bring about change. It reflects the
              framework they will use to read and understand your history and
              your experiences, and the tools they&apos;ll call on to help you
              cultivate your own awareness, understanding, and ultimately,
              transformation.
              <br /> <br />
              It&apos;s not a bad idea to conduct a little research at this
              stage and there are lots of resources available on the Internet
              (i.e., this directory from Good Therapy), but it is a bad idea to
              get stuck here or hung up on jargon. Once you come up with your
              short list of candidates, it&apos;s perfectly legitimate to ask
              her to explain her approach in lay-terms. <br /> <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              Ask yourself which practical considerations are important to you -
              These factors often determine whether or not you actually make it
              to therapy. And therapy won&apos;t work if you don&apos;t go. Do
              give these considerations just weight.
              <ul className="single-column">
                <li>
                  <span>Cost</span>: How much will sessions cost, do you have
                  insurance coverage, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>Location</span>: Is it convenient for you to get to the

                  sense for you?
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>Availability</span>: Does the therapist have office
                  hours that work for you (evenings, weekends)? Do they offer
                  teletherapy?
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>Qualifications</span>: Is it important to you that your
                  therapist have any particular qualifications, training,
                  knowledge, or experience?
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>Other considerations</span>: Sex/gender, age,
                  race/ethnicity, religious faith, sexual orientation. It may be
                  important for you to feel that your therapist can relate to a
                  particular domain of experience. If this is the case, be
                  honest with yourself. For example, a person working through
                  sexual assault trauma may not want to work with a male
                  therapist if her assailant was a man. Feeling a sense of
                  safety and trust is crucial to being able to open up in
                  therapy. Sometimes ostensibly “personal” factors do matter
                  when choosing a therapist.

              Do your research - Now that you&apos;re clear on which criteria
              you find most important, you can go forth and conduct your search.
              But where should you look?
              <ul className="single-column">
                <li>
                  <span>Personal References</span>: I know this may be a private
                  matter, but other people are often your best resources. Ask
                  around (i.e., trusted friends and family, your doctor,
                  alternative health care practitioners such as naturopaths or
                  physiotherapists, etc.).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>Directories</span>: for example, Psychology Today or the
                  CRPO directory for general inquiries. Or consult specialist
                  directories if you know your desired treatment modality.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>Internet searches</span>: I know, I know, it&apos;s a
                  terrible rabbit hole, but if you have a refined or specialized
                  idea of what you&apos;re seeking it can yield helpful results.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>Local advertisements</span>: Keep an eye open for
                  advertisements or flyers in places you frequent or for clinics
                  or practitioners near your home, work, or in neighbourhoods /
                  communities you often visit.

              </ul>
              <br />
            </li>

            <li>
              Make a short list of candidates - Who resonates with you? By now
              you&apos;ve probably read lots of advertisements and web sites.
              Trust yourself to know who&apos;s making a connection. Aim to find
              2-4 therapists you think could be a good fit. Or perhaps you have
              a strong feeling about one individual based on their web site, a
              personal reference, etc.?
            </li>
            <br />

            <li>
              Make a brief phone consultation - It&apos;s time well spent to
              contact or interview a practitioner before you make your initial
              appointment. Many therapists offer a short phone consultation free
              of charge. Those who don&apos;t advertise this fact may still be
              willing to take a short call. This is your opportunity to ask any
              questions you might have about the therapist&apos;s
              qualifications, approach, availability, fees, etc. Sometimes
              candidates weed themselves out quickly once you get them on the
              phone. Does the practitioner respond to you in a timely and
              professional manner? Are they attentive? Do they seem interested
              in you and your concerns? When you talk, do they make you feel
              heard? Do your schedules work? Do you get a good vibe?
            </li>
            <br />

            <li>
              Listen, and trust your intuition - Do you get a good vibe? This is
              admittedly an unscientific question. But fit is the alchemical
              x-factor that makes for a strong therapeutic alliance. The
              collaborative relationship between client and therapist is the
              most reliable indicator of whether a the therapy will be helpful.
              Doing your research matters, but when making a final decision you
              also need to listen to your gut.
